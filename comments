 * 2.7 is a bugfix release
 * removed some weird code parts that suddenly popped up in 2.6 (skip Version 2.6!)
 * removed bugs around litersTank and litersConsumed variables
 * EEprom default value litersConsumed (since refill) set from 10,0 to 0.01
 * EEprom default value kmTank (since refill) set from 10,0 to 0.1
 * ...this will lead to more realistic values in tankstop-screen after values reset
